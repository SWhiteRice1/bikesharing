As shown in the graph above, majority of users are male Subscribers. More subscribers means a company with a steadier income then always waiting for more customers. However, having more one-off customers could be a marketing opportunity.

### Time of Bike Usage

Majority of users take the bikes to ride for under an hour. So stations will only be needed small distances apart.

Of these users, most who take the bike for short distances are men. Since males are the ones to use the bikes more often, taller bikes may be best for the subscribers.

Men also are using the bike between the hours of 8-9 AM and 5-7 PM Monday through Friday while Saturday's have more usage throghout the day.

Male use of the bikes is consistent with the average times used for the bikes. 

### Bike Station Locations

The above graph reflects the starting locations of riders. The larger and more orange the circle, the more often that location is a starting location. The middle of the city is most popular for a starting location. In Des Moines, this may also be the case with tourists. Additionally, the starting and ending locations are similar, so bike stations will not need to be far apart.

## Summary
  The above graphs give a consistent view that in NYC, citi bikes are most often used by male subscribers for short distances to get to and from work on Weekdays and for sproadic use on Saturdays. To get a better understanding of how bikesharing would work in Des Moines, it would be helpful to have another vizualization of how often maintenance occurs on the bikes and the average pay for customer. It is important to see what the return on investment will be.
